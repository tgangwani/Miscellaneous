Use of TensorFlow to construct convolutional neural nets 

run.py : program start

models/ : contains the abstract base class 'neuralnet' 

datasets/ : contains datafile classes which derive from the base class 'neuralnet'. These class internally define more classes which implement different architectures of the neural nets. Currently only has MNIST.
